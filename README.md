# Strike Tools blender addon

This is an addon I use for testing features and fixing small papercuts that I have with Blender. Feel free to download and try it, but be prepared for not everything to work and for an addon that is focussed on on my specific workflow rather than being as adaptable as possible.

Currently it contains:
* A prototype of my (now released) node pie addon (this is disabled by default)
* Operators for extracting node values into dedicated input nodes, and also for converting those input nodes into group inputs of their parent group.
